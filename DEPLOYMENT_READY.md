## 🎯 Ready to Deploy - 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Create Hetzner VPS (5 minutes)
1. Go to [Hetzner Cloud](https://accounts.hetzner.com/signUp)
2. Create account & enable 2FA
3. Create server:
   - **Type**: CX22 (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) - €3.79/month
   - **Image**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - **Create firewall** with ports: 22, 80, 443, 3000

### Step 2: Upload & Deploy (10 minutes)
```bash
# SSH to your VPS
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Upload your project (choose one method):

# Option A: Git clone
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/buyermap-app.git
cd buyermap-app

# Option B: SCP upload
# (from local machine)
scp -r /path/to/buyermap-app root@YOUR_VPS_IP:/root/

# Deploy Fider
./scripts/vps-setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Access & Configure (5 minutes)
1. Open `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:3000`
2. Create admin account (first user becomes admin)
3. Customize your feedback board
4. Update BuyerMap to point to your VPS

## 🌐 Optional: Custom Domain Setup

After basic deployment, enhance with custom domain:

```bash
# On your VPS
./scripts/configure-domain.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Configure DNS settings
- ✅ Obtain SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- ✅ Set up HTTPS
- ✅ Configure auto-renewal

## 💰 Total Cost Breakdown

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| Hetzner CX22 VPS | €3.79 ($4.10) |
| Domain (optional) | ~$1.00 |
| SSL Certificate | Free |
| **Total** | **~$5/month** |

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Tasks:

```

## 📊 Success Metrics

After deployment, you'll have:

✅ **Production-ready** feedback system  
✅ **Self-hosted** - your data stays with you  
✅ **Cost-effective** - ~$5/month vs $50-200/month SaaS

## 🚨 Need Help?

### Quick Tests:
```bash
# Test local configuration
npm run feedback:test

# Check VPS deployment
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP "cd buyermap-app && docker-compose ps"

# View logs
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP "cd buyermap-app && docker-compose logs fider"
```

### Common Issues:
- **Can't access Fider**: Check firewall allows port 3000
- **SSL issues**: Ensure DNS points to VPS before running domain script
- **Email not working**: Use Gmail app password, not regular password

## 🎉 Ready to Launch!

Your BuyerMap feedback system is production-ready. The deployment process will take ~20 minutes total and cost ~$5/month.

**Next Action**: Create your Hetzner VPS and run the deployment script!

**💡 Pro Tip**: Start with basic deployment, then add domain/SSL later. You can always enhance the setup without losing data.
