Our current customers like Fashion Forward ($85M) and Home Essentials ($120M) fall within this bracket. Our sales team has found that companies below $25M typically don't have the operational complexity to justify our solution, while companies above $300M often have custom enterprise systems that are harder to displace.",
    "realityFromInterviews": "GAP IDENTIFIED: The interviews reveal that successful customers actually span a broader range - from $25M companies with 50 SKUs to $300M companies with 200+ SKUs. The key factor isn't revenue size but complexity of operations. Companies with complex multi-location setups, regardless of revenue, see the most value from Return Treasure.",
    "keyFinding": "GAP IDENTIFIED: While our deck targets $50-200M revenue companies, interviews reveal that operational complexity, not revenue size, is the true indicator of need. Companies with $35M revenue but 180 SKUs across three warehouses face more acute pain points than larger companies with simpler operations. Return Treasure should expand targeting to include companies with complex multi-location setups regardless of revenue, and develop specific messaging for smaller companies with high SKU counts.",
